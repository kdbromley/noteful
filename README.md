# Noteful App
Noteful is an app for making note and organizing them within folders. Get that grocery list out of your mind and onto your screen!

## Live App
This app was built as a capstone project for the React portion of my program at Thinkful. Because I've only just begun learning server-side skills, the Noteful app is configured to run on a local server provided by Thinkful. As a result, I can't necessarily deploy a live app, at the moment, but below are screenshots providing some representation of the app's UI and functionality. As I progress with my the server-side part of my program, the app will be expanded to be deployed as a live app!

### Screenshots
